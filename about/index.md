This set of pages started out as a series of short messages send to a friend of mine who had just installed Linux. I wanted to help him out by providing brief tips about Linux, mostly command line usage (in fact, most examples would apply to any Unix, as they focus mainly on the command line tools, though in particular the GNU variant of these tools).

After a few tips, I figured it would be easier to put them somewhere more definite. That way, I could update them later, with corrected or added information. That is how these pages came about.

Of course, there are hundreds or more Linux tutorials and tips out there. This list is mainly just for my own fun, but other people may find them useful. Also, if you have corrections, additions or other suggestions, feel free to file an issue at [the GitHub repository](github.com/evertrol/linux-tips). This may concern simple typos, different phrasing, better or corrected usage of some commands, suggestions for other commands, a whole new chapter, and so on. 

Keep in mind this is all short and simple: I wrote most of these in the timespan of about twenty minutes, very occasionally checking the output of a command, and did certainly not intend to list every possible command option, or alternative commands (for example, should I mention `grep`, but then also explain `ack`, `ag`, `rg` and friends?) That avoids lengthy pages, although brief mentions or pointers to extras can be included. And perhaps there will be an "extended" version of these tips, with more details and specialized commands.
